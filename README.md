This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in VHDL code: an infinite loop in a counter.  The `buggy_counter.vhdl` file contains the erroneous code, while `buggy_counter_solution.vhdl` provides the corrected version.  The bug arises from a potential overflow condition not being handled properly, which can lead to unexpected behavior and simulation issues. The corrected version utilizes a modulo operator to prevent the counter from exceeding its maximum value, ensuring proper cycling.
